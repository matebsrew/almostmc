ZernFlow is an open-source alternative to ManyChat. Build visual chatbot flows, manage contacts, send broadcasts, run drip campaigns, and handle live chat conversations across 6 social media platforms.

**Powered by [Zernio](https://zernio.com)** for OAuth, token refresh, rate limiting, and cross-platform messaging.

- **AI Response Node** - AI-powered replies via OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google (Vercel AI SDK)
- **Live Chat Inbox** - Real-time inbox with human takeover and conversation assignment
- **Contact CRM** - Tags, custom fields, segments, and contact management
- **Broadcasting** - Send targeted messages to contact segments
- **Sequences** - Drip campaigns with timed message series and automatic enrollment
- **Team Management** - Invite members, assign roles, manage permissions
- **Multi-Platform** - Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, Twitter/X, Bluesky, Reddit
- **Connect Channels** - OAuth connection flow directly from ZernFlow (powered by Zernio)
- **Rich Messaging** - Buttons, quick replies, and carousel cards
- **Comment-to-DM** - Automatically DM users who comment specific keywords
- **Growth Tools** - Conversation starter links for each connected platform
- **A/B Testing** - Split test different message paths
- **Webhooks & HTTP** - Connect to external APIs from your flows

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)
- A [Zernio](https://zernio.com) API key (entered in Settings after setup)
- A [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) key (optional, for AI node, entered in Settings or env)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matebsrew/almostmc.git
cd almostmc
npm install
```

2. **Set up Supabase**

Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). Then run the SQL migrations in the Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Run each numbered file in supabase/migrations/ in order (00001 through 00011).
# ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql is a convenience export, not the source of truth.
```

3. **Configure environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
CRON_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters # Bearer token for scheduled endpoints
# AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...                  # Optional, for self-hosted (Vercel handles this automatically)
```

After starting the app, go to **Settings** to enter your Zernio API key and (optionally) AI Gateway key.

4. **Run**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign up, and start building flows.

### Scheduled work

The scheduled-job, sequence, and webhook-processing endpoints expect an `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header. Do not pass the secret in a query string. `vercel.json` runs all three endpoints once per day so it deploys on Vercel Hobby; change the schedules to `* * * * *` on Pro/Enterprise. On Hobby, configure an external scheduler to call all three endpoints at least once per minute. The webhook receiver validates the Zernio signature, stores each event, and returns `202`; the webhook cron processes the stored event.

Before applying migration `00011`, review any preflight error and repair the named legacy rows. The migration intentionally stops when roles, pending owner invitations, ownership, or cross-workspace relations violate the new constraints. It copies existing API and webhook secrets into service-only tables before dropping the old workspace/channel columns.
